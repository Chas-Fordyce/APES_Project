** The Game (Chas' idea) **
- Starts off with character in a general space
	- Tutorial dialogue boxes help you through first part
- Go into bank(?) and get some money to start the company(ies)
- Go to company-buying place and buy either/or
	- While buying, gives real info on what each company will require and how they work
	  (also maybe statistics on previous years of data for fishing or mining?)
- After buying, a new icon in corner of screen appears
	- Helps manage each company while not at the office(?) for each company
- Can skip various amounts of time
	- Weeks, months, or years
	- Check progress along the way
- Some sort of economy/environment system that randomly fluctuates both prices and natural
  disasters to keep things fresh (probably the last thing we will add if at all)
