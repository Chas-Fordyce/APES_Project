Thanks for playing the resource management game! This is the bank. The
bank is where you can see your monetary balance and see the tutorial.

GOAL OF THE GAME
----------------
As a company owner, you are trying to make as many profits as possible.
To start you have just enough money to purchase either a mining or a
fishing company. Over the next months and years, you attempt to
maximize profits by purchasing upgrades and eventually buying the other
company (depending on whether you bought mining or fishing first.)

HOW TO PLAY
-----------
This is your chance to own the fishing or mining company of that you've
always dreamed of. To start, you can see your money at the top left of
your screen. This starting cash is just enough to start a very basic
corporation. To buy said company, you need to go into the corresponding
store on the main street.

Once you picked which business to start and entered the correct store,
you will see a tech-tree. This tech tree will define how you build your
corporation. After you pick a starting tree, you will be able to branch
out and pick new upgrades after you start earning money.

Later, you will be able to go to your company building, labeled,
"Fishing and Mining Inc." where you can manage your company and advance
forward in time. From the menu, you will be able to manage employees,
view your annual expenses, and view your company overall. To go forward
in time, click the button and select which amount of time you would
like to advance.

Good luck and happy entrepreneuring!
